# iAmAlive

iAmAlive app is an application that confirms if a host is attached to the network and triggers a collaborative action on tropo - send a sms to the network admin if the host is reachable - call the network admin if the host is unreachable.

The idea is to demonstrate the capabilities of APIC-EM as well as Tropo API and how they can be used together to facilitate collaboration within distributed teams.
